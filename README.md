# Production Readme

To complete your full stack project you will have to create a production
readme.  The purpose of the readme is to show off your technical skills
and guide someone who is visiting your repo for the first time.  Think
of it like a resume or cover letter - the production readme is an
introduction to you as a skilled developer!  There's a lot of great code
hidden in your repo (and potentially some code you're okay with an
employer not seeing), so use the readme to show off the places you
excel.    

### Features of a great production readme:
* Brief explanation of what the app is and does
* Link to live site
* Discussion of technologies used
* Delve deep into ~2 features that show off your technical abilities.
  Discuss both the challenges faced and your brilliant solutions.    
* Code snippets to highlight your best code (markdown code snippets, NOT
screenshots)


### Pitfalls to avoid:
* Do not list out every single feature on your app.
* No screenshots; only screen clippings.  i.e.  Don't show your entire
browser window and several other open tabs.
* Don't refer to your app as your 'App Academy Full-Stack Project'.
Present it as a professional site.
* Don't wax on about the features that you didn't have time to
implement.  Simply list them at the bottom of the readme as future
directions for the project.   
* Markdown rendering errors

Make sure to allot at least 3 hours to write your readme.
